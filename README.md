This is a small project based on the
[Roguelike Tutorial - in Rust](https://bfnightly.bracketproductions.com/) series of tutorials.

## Current Status

As of v1.5.0 I am at Chapter 2 of the tutorial.
At this point I have a functional world where there are movable mobs and renderable player.
I have also implemented a map generation and collision system.
