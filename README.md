This is a small project based on the
[Roguelike Tutorial - in Rust](https://bfnightly.bracketproductions.com/) series of tutorials.

## Current Status

As of v1.3.0 I am at Chapter 1 of the tutorial. At this point I have a functional world where there are movable mobs and renderable player.

## License

The original tutorial is licensed under the MIT License so this project is following the same license.
